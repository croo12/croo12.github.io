# Create entities layer with domain models

**Category:** Architecture / FSD
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** `src/entities/` (empty, only `.gitkeep`)

## Problem
No domain models defined. The FSD architecture spec calls for entities like `GameState`, `Player`, etc.

## Suggested Fix
Create at minimum a `GameState` entity as the game logic grows.
