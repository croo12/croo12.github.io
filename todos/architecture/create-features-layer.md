# Create features layer with user action slices

**Category:** Architecture / FSD
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** `src/features/` (empty, only `.gitkeep`)

## Problem
No user-action feature slices exist. "Start game", "save score" etc. should live here.

## Suggested Fix
Create feature slices as game functionality is implemented.
