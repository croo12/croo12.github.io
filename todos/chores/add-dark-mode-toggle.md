# Add dark/light mode toggle

**Category:** Feature / Theme
**Priority:** Low
**File:** `src/shared/theme/`

## Problem
Theme is dark-only with hardcoded CSS variables. No way to switch themes.

## Suggested Fix
Add a theme toggle that switches CSS custom properties. Store preference in localStorage.
