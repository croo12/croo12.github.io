# Replace PROJECT.md with proper contributing guide

**Category:** Documentation
**Priority:** Low
**File:** `PROJECT.md`

## Problem
PROJECT.md reads as an AI conversation summary, not actionable developer docs.

## Suggested Fix
Replace with a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup instructions, coding guidelines, PR process.
