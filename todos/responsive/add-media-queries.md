# Add responsive media queries

**Category:** Responsive Design
**Priority:** High
**Files:** All CSS files

## Problem
No `@media` queries exist anywhere in the project. The entire app is non-responsive.

## Suggested Fix
Add breakpoints for mobile (< 640px), tablet (< 1024px) to layout.css and page-specific CSS.
